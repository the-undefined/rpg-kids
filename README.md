RPG Kids
=======

Have the computer narrate events to act out with the kids - great for weekends!

## Example scenario:
> While flying on giant eagles to the giant spiders lair you are attacked by a flock of pidgeons

Act out what you hear! Fun times ensue.

## Usage

(Requires the `say` command to be installed.)

Dowload the repo (for now):

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:the-undefined/rpg.git
$ cd rpg
```
Run the file:

```bash
$ ruby game.rb
```

Have the kids press the `ENTER` key when you finished with a scenario to hear the next one.
